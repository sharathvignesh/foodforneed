Food for need is a platform to donate food for the needy people.
The best use case is, say Mr.x is organizing a party in his office. At the end of the party he realizes that food is in excess and it can feed around 20 people. He can use our app and put on an information about the excess food. Old age homes, orphanages can contact the donors and make use of the excess food to feed the needy ones.
